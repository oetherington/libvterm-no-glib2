#libvterm

Based on ROTE by Bruno Takahashi C. de Oliveira, libvterm is a terminal emulator
library by Bryan Christ that attempts to mimic both VT100 and rxvt capabilities.

This is a fully functional fork of libvterm with all dependencies on glib2.0
removed and replaced with standard library functions. This makes it far more
suitable for use in smaller applications or embedded systems.
